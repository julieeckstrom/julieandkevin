						<h1>it’s a weekend affair</h1>
						<h3>Thursday, June 20, 2019</h3>
						<p>For those spending time in Pittsburgh before the weekend, we'll be hosting an open house / back-yard BBQ late Thursday afternoon.</p>
						<h3>Friday, June 21, 2019 (by invitation only)</h3>
						<p>We’ll kick off the weekend with a dinner at Gateway Lodge. Think of this as a rehearsal dinner, except not.</p>
						<h3>Saturday, June 22, 2019</h3>
						<p>There will be an (optional, but super fun) outdoor adventure during the day on Saturday, either hiking or tubing down the Clarion River (we haven’t quite figured this out yet). The ceremony will be in the late afternoon with dinner and evening activities to follow. More detailed itinerary to follow.</p>

						<h1>with a small moment for us</h1>
						<p>When it comes to our wedding, the rituals of a traditional ceremony just don’t feel right to us, so we know this will be a little different. We want to give everyone a heads up for what to expect, and we’ll add more information here when we figure it out ourselves. It won’t be anything too crazy. One thing we do know, however, is that in Pennsylvania you can self-wed thanks to the Quakers, which means we’ll be marrying ourselves!</p>

						<h1>at Gateway Lodge amongst the old pines of Cook Forest.</h1>
						<p>The weekend will take place at <a href="http://www.gatewaylodge.com/" target="_blank">Gateway Lodge</a> in Cook Forest. We first discovered the old lodge when sneaking away from Pittsburgh to spend a weekend <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glamping" target="_blank">glamping</a>, and we can’t wait to share the lodge and <a href="http://cookforest.com/" target="_blank">Cook Forest State Park</a> with all of you!</p>
						<p>Gateway Lodge is about a 2 hour drive north of Pittsburgh. Since many may be flying in, you can look for flights to the Pittsburgh International Airport, or to the Cleveland Hopkins International airport if that’s more convenient, which is about 2 hours and 30 minutes from Gateway.</p>

						<h1>there are few choices for where to stay</h1>
						<p>Our closest friends and family have been invited to stay with us at the lodge, which unfortunately has too few rooms for all the guests we want to invite! Below are other options for those not staying at the lodge, or for those who choose to stay elsewhere:</p>
						<h3>Luxury, Retreat, or Rustic Cabins</h3>
						<p>Gateway Lodge also owns and manages a few cabins that are nearby. More information about the cabins can be <a href="https://www.gatewaylodge.com/cabins" target=“_blank”>found here.</a> These would be perfect for groups who want to stay together.</p>
						<p>We have a block on these cabins right now so they’re available for the weekend. If you want to stay in one of these, let us know and we’ll provide you with information on how to book.</p>
						<h3>Campsites</h3>
						<p>If you’d like to be even closer to nature, there are plenty of campgrounds nearby. <a href="http://www.pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/camping/cook-forest-state-park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=PA&parkId=880202" target="_blank">The state park campground</a> is just across the river from the lodge. A few guests have also decided to stay at <a href="http://campersparadise.net/" target="_blank">Camper's Paradise</a>, about a 15 minute drive from the lodge.</p>
						<h3>Hotels 20 minutes away in Clarion, PA</h3>
						<p>The nearest town to Gateway Lodge is Clarion, Pennsylvania, about a 20 minute drive to the lodge. There are a few hotels here, including the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/clarion/dujcl/hoteldetail" target="_blank">Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites Clarion</a> and <a href="https://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/pennsylvania/hampton-inn-clarion-CLAPAHX/index.html" target="_blank">Hampton Inn Clarion</a>.</p>

						<p>Cook Forest is seriously amazing, with so many ways to enjoy the park! We’re going to organize some sort of activity on Saturday, either hiking or tubing down the Clarion River, which of course will be optional.</p>
						<p>We’ll add additional information, packing suggestions, and more good-to-knows here once we have things more fully planned.</p>

						<p>We truly, honestly feel that the best gift anyone could give to us is their presence during the weekend. When thinking about what we wanted to do for our wedding, we quickly realized that we wanted to deemphasize all of the pomp around a wedding and just spend time with our family and friends. We know it will be a trek for some to join us, and because of this we would much rather enjoy time with you than receive a gift.</p>
						<p>Still, some people have asked us what we would enjoy. We don’t want to make this harder for people, so we put together <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wedding/share/julie-eckstrom-and-kevin-kuntz" target="_blank">a small registry on Amazon</a> and set up <a href="https://www.tendr.com/julieandkevin2019" target=“_blank”>this Tendr account</a> should you somehow feel that your presence at Gateway and Cook Forest isn’t enough.</p>
