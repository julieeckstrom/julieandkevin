						<p>The events will take place at Gateway Lodge. Unfortunately, there is not enough room at the lodge for everyone we dearly wish to have with us for this occasion, and our closest friends have been invited to stay with us at the lodge. For those who aren’t staying at the lodge, below are some options for the weekend:</p>
						<h3>Black Bear Cabins</h3>
						<p>These are 4 cabins that are owned and managed by Gateway Lodge, about a half mile up the road. One cabin has two bedrooms, and the other three have three-bedrooms (the third bedroom is bunk beds). These are perfect for a group who may want to stay together.</p>
						<h3>Other Cabins</h3>
						<p>If you’d like to bring your camper or pitch a tent, there are plenty of campgrounds nearby.</p>

						<h3>Hotels 20 minutes away in Clarion, PA</h3>
						<p>The nearest town to Gateway Lodge is Clarion, Pennsylvania, about a 20 minute drive to the lodge. There are a few hotels here, including the Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites Clarion and Hampton Inn Clarion. We will not be making a room block since many guests may choose to stay at a campground or cabin.</p>
