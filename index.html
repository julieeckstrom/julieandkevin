				<p class="caption">*We wanted to prepare everyone for the ceremony since it's a bit different from the usual. It'll be closer to the Quaker style, where we gather in a circle and everyone has an opportunity to speak if desired. Feel free to say nothing, add in a few words, or speak in the moment as you feel.</p>

				<h1>Location</h1>
				<p>The weekend will take place at <a href="http://www.gatewaylodge.com/" target="_blank">Gateway Lodge</a> in Cook Forest. We first discovered the old lodge when sneaking away from Pittsburgh to spend a weekend <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glamping" target="_blank">glamping</a>, and we can’t wait to share the lodge and <a href="http://cookforest.com/" target="_blank">Cook Forest State Park</a> with all of you!</p>
			</div><div class="col col-50">
				<h1>Directions</h1>
				<p>Gateway Lodge is about a 2 hour drive north of Pittsburgh. Since many may be flying in, you can look for flights to the Pittsburgh International Airport, or to the Cleveland Hopkins International airport if that’s more convenient, which is about 2 hours and 30 minutes from Gateway.</p>

				<h3>Some are staying at Gateway Lodge</h3>
				<p>Our closest friends and family have been invited to stay with us at the lodge, which unfortunately has too few rooms for all the guests we want to invite! We wanted to provide some information on other options.</p>
				<h3>Campsites</h3>
				<p>If you’d like to be even closer to nature, there are plenty of campgrounds nearby. <a href="http://www.pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/camping/cook-forest-state-park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=PA&parkId=880202" target="_blank">The state park campground</a> is just across the river from the lodge. A few guests have also decided to stay at <a href="http://campersparadise.net/" target="_blank">Camper's Paradise</a>, about a 15 minute drive from the lodge.</p>
			</div><div class="col col-50">
				<h3>Hotels 20 minutes away in Clarion, PA</h3>
				<p>The nearest town to Gateway Lodge is Clarion, Pennsylvania, about a 20 minute drive to the lodge. There are a few hotels here, including the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/clarion/dujcl/hoteldetail" target="_blank">Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites Clarion</a> and <a href="https://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/pennsylvania/hampton-inn-clarion-CLAPAHX/index.html" target="_blank">Hampton Inn Clarion</a>.</p>

				<h1>Good to Know</h1>
				<p>Cook Forest is beautiful with a lot to do. There's river tubing, kayaking, and conoeing, hiking, trail riding, and more. You can find out more about the area on the <a href="https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/CookForestStatePark/Pages/default.aspx">state park website</a>.</p>
				<p>The weather in June is typically a high in the high 70s and low in the mid 50s. If it's a typical day, it'll feel warm.</p>

				<h1>About Gifts</h1>
				<p>We truly, honestly feel that the best gift anyone could give to us is their presence during the weekend. When thinking about what we wanted to do for our wedding, we quickly realized that we wanted to deemphasize all of the pomp around a wedding and just spend time with our family and friends. We know it will be a trek for some to join us, and because of this we would much rather enjoy time with you than receive a gift.</p>
				<p>Still, some people have asked us what we would enjoy. We don’t want to make this harder for people, so we put together <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wedding/share/julie-eckstrom-and-kevin-kuntz" target="_blank">a small registry on Amazon</a> and set up <a href="https://www.tendr.com/julieandkevin2019" target=“_blank”>this Tendr account</a> should you somehow feel that your presence at Gateway and Cook Forest isn’t enough.</p>
